# omnitool

A hackable Python package for performing low-level photometric and asteroseismic analysis.

In other words, an umbrella package for any classes I write to do menial analysis tasks on repeat!

Please feel free to hack in any fixes or add your own classes if you fancy!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine. The package is not pip installable,
so you'll have to clone the respository and install from there.

### Installing

In a directory of your choice, run the following from commandline:

```
git clone https://github.com/ojhall94/omnitool.git
sudo python setup.py install
```

If you want to branch off and make your own changes to the package (which I highly encourage), run the following:

```
cd omnitool
git branch <your-branch-name>
git checkout <your-branch-name>
```

The final line can be used to install any changes you make to your local repository to your local machine.
If you are new to GitHub, this 'cheat-sheet' might help with commandline commands: https://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet/

## Running and example

Examples for current functions and classes can be found in the examples folder on the repo in easy-to-read and commented IPython Notebook format!

## Contributing

This isn't a proper 'package' per-se, just a collection of useful functions and classes that share some inter-connected functionality. If you want to make changes or edit any code for your own use, please do!

In fact, the only thing I ask is that if you're happy with your changes, push them to this respository and make a pull request, so they become open source and others can use them too :)

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for further details on code of conduct, and the process for submitting pull requests to me.
